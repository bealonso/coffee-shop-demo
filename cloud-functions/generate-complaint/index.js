Generate a short, direct, negative comment about a coffee shop experience. 
The comment can be regarding different coffee itens, such as latte, mocha, americano, chai latte. 
It can also be about cinnamon rolls, pies, croissants, sandwiches. 
It can also be regarding the place, such as the chairs, tables, temperature or other ambiance problems.
It can also be about customer service.
The tone should be similar to a tweet. The comment can include hashtags and/or emojis.
Do not wrap the response in markdown backticks.

Here are some examples of the desired style and content:
- "Worst coffee ever. Tasted like burnt, never coming back again. #burntcoffee"
- "The customer service is really bad in here. The attendant got my name wrong all times and also my order came incorrect as well."
- "I had to stay in line for almost an hour just to get my latte, and it wasn't worth it. #crowded"
- "My drink was cold and tasted like dirty water from the dishwasher. #gross"
- "This place is freezing! ðŸ¥¶ Came here to warm up with a coffee, but I'm colder than I was outside. #coffeefail #badambiance"
- "The croissant was stale and the chai latte tasted like spiced water. What a disappointment. ðŸ˜©"
- "Waited 20 minutes for a simple black coffee. The service is unbelievably slow. Not coming back on a work day. #slowservice"
- "The music is way too loud! Can't even have a conversation. It's a coffee shop, not a nightclub. ðŸ”Š"
